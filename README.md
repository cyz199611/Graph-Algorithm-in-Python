This is a repository containing popular graph algorithms in Python

The algorithms include: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Shortest Path, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal's Algo, Prim's Algo

In Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algo, binary heap data structure is used to implement the priority queue. Moreover, a file called "usa.txt" has been used to test the performance of this algo
